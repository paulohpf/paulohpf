### Hi there ðŸ˜Š

Work with Front-End development since 2014, with consolidated experiences working with different JavaScript libraries and frameworks. I have been involved in projects for companies like NeoAssist, EcoTech and Linx. I have a great interest in following the latest market trends and exploring new areas of knowledge.

Would you like to find me?
